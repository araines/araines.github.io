![Three Devs and a Maybe][cover]

I had a great chat with [Edd Mann][eddmann] on the [Three Devs and a Maybe
podcast][podcast] about Serverless, AWS and about how constraints in software
development can be a good thing.  Thanks to Edd for inviting me on to the
podcast!

You can find it on [their website][episode] or on [iTunes][itunes].
